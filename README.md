If you enter a sitemap (without another sitemap below it) and the base domain, each of the pages will be searched for non-domain accesses. Theoretically, you can see on which Wordpress subpage Google Fonts are used remotely. Attention, this is only a test script which is not intended for production use. I do not guarantee that you can find out everything with it. Use at your own risk. Alpha version.
