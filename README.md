# python-find-network-requests

Simple script to go through pages via a sitemap and look where Google Fonts and other exemplary resources are loaded externally.

I am looking forward to further developers who optimize the script.

The script is intended for testing purposes only. Use at your own risk. No guarantee for completeness of the analysis.
